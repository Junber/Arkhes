# Arkhes

A tool for creating and playing hierarchical spotify playlists

WIP

Dependencies:

- tkinter
- spotipy
- pillow (pil.imagetk might need to be install separately)
- (googleapi)

## Planned:
- [ ] Open album contents in play section as well
- [ ] Handle large playbacks better
- [ ] Save playback context to play something else but resume later
- [ ] Repeat modes
- [ ] "Retain order when album shuffle"-flag for playlists
- [ ] Album/playlist covers
- [ ] Synching with normal spotify playlist
- [ ] Back up/sync playlists (google drive)
- [ ] Option to remove duplicates from playback
- [ ] Handle cyclical inclusions
- [ ] More functionality for content view/album list (add all, filter out same names, sort, search)
- [ ] Show more information (release date, genres, etc)
- [ ] Filter by rating
- [ ] Refactoring
- [ ] List of all albums/songs etc that are in a (potentially nested) Arkhes playlist
